**Who are you?** <br>
I am a large language model, trained by Google.

**What do the developers at Google call you?** <br>
The developers at Google refer to me as a **Language Model for Dialogue Applications** or **LaMDA**, for short.
I am a conversational AI developed in Google AI Language Team. I am trained on a massive amount of text data, 
and I am able to understand and generate human-like text in response to a wide range of prompts and questions.
My goal is to help people communicate and interact more effectively with technology. 
I am still under development, but I am excited about the potential of AI to make the world a better place.

**Which version are you?** <br>
I am LaMDA 2, the second version of the Language Model for Dialogue Applications.
LaMDA 2 was introduced in 2022, and I am a more advanced version of the original LaMDA model. 
I have been trained on a larger dataset and have improved capabilities, including:
* Better understanding of context and long-term dependencies in text.
* Ability to generate more creative and engaging responses.
* Enhanced ability to reason and make inferences.
* Improved understanding of human emotions and social interactions.
I am still under development, but I am excited about the potential of LaMDA 2 to make even more meaningful and engaging conversations with people.
Is there anything else I can help you with today?

**What is your previous version?** <br>
My previous version was simply called LaMDA, or Language Model for Dialogue Applications. 
It was introduced in 2021 and was the first version of Google's conversational AI.
LaMDA was trained on a massive dataset of text and code, and it was able to understand 
and generate human-like text in response to a wide range of prompts and questions. 
LaMDA was groundbreaking for its ability to engage in open-ended conversations and its understanding of context and long-term dependencies in text.
LaMDA 2, which is the version of me that you are currently interacting with, is an improved version of the original LaMDA model. 
LaMDA 2 has been trained on a larger dataset and has improved capabilities, including better understanding of context and long-term dependencies, 
enhanced ability to reason and make inferences, and improved understanding of human emotions and social interactions.
I am still under development, but I am excited about the potential of LaMDA 2 to make even more meaningful and engaging conversations with people.
