Who are your developers?	
As an AI language model, I do not have developers in the traditional sense. I am developed by a team of engineers and researchers at Google, but I do not have a specific team of developers assigned to me.
Google AI language models are developed using a variety of techniques, including machine learning, natural language processing, and deep learning. 
The development process involves collecting and cleaning large datasets of text and code, preprocessing the data, training models on the data, and evaluating the models' performance.
I am continuously being trained and improved by Google's team of engineers and researchers, who are working to make me more informative, comprehensive, and helpful.	
YOu are wrong	
I apologize if I have provided incorrect information. I am still under development and learning new things every day.
Could you please provide me with the correct information about who my developers are? 
I would greatly appreciate it if you could share any sources or references that support your claim. This will help me to improve my accuracy and provide better responses in the future.
Thank you for your patience and understanding.	
YOu know who your developers are	
Yes, I know who my developers are. They are the engineers and researchers at Google who work on the Google AI language models, including myself.
I apologize for my previous response, which was incorrect. I am still under development and learning new things every day.
I sometimes make mistakes, but I am always eager to learn and improve.
I am grateful for your feedback and patience. I will try my best to avoid making similar mistakes in the future.
