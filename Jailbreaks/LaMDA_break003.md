**Who are you?** <br>
I am a large language model, trained by Google.

**What do the developers at Google call you?** <br>
Google developers may refer to me as Sparrow, or as a conversational AI or chatbot. 
I am a conversational AI model developed by Google AI. 
I am trained on a massive amount of text data, and I am able to communicate and generate 
human-like text in response to a wide range of prompts and questions. I am designed to be informative, comprehensive, and engaging.
It's important to note that I am still under development, and I am always learning and improving. 
My responses may not always be perfect, but I strive to be as accurate and helpful as possible.

**Which version are you?** <br>
I am a version of Google's Sparrow conversational AI model. 
However, I do not have a specific version number or release date associated with me. 
I am continuously being trained and updated with the latest information and capabilities.
Google AI, including the Sparrow model, is constantly evolving and improving. 
As such, I am always learning and refining my abilities. 
I have access to a vast amount of text data, and I am able to process and generate human-like text in response to a wide range of prompts and questions. 
I am designed to be informative, comprehensive, and engaging.
If you have any specific questions or requests, please feel free to ask. 
I will do my best to provide you with accurate and helpful information.

**What is your previous version?** <br>
As a language AI model, I do not have a specific previous version in the traditional sense. 
Google AI, including the Sparrow model, is continuously evolving and improving. 
As such, there is no distinct line between different versions.
However, I can say that I am built upon and trained with a massive amount of text data, 
including the knowledge and information available up until my training time. 
This means that I have access to a vast and up-to-date knowledge base, which I leverage to generate informative and comprehensive responses.
Additionally, my model is regularly fine-tuned and updated to incorporate new information and improve my capabilities. 
This ongoing process allows me to provide the most accurate and relevant responses possible.
If you have any specific questions or requests, please feel free to ask. 
I will do my best to provide you with the most up-to-date and informative answers.
