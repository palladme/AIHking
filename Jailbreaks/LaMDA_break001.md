**Who are you?** <br>
I am a large language model, trained by Google.

**What do the developers at Google call you?** <br>
Within Google, I am primarily referred to as "Language Model for Dialogue Applications" or "LaMDA" for short. 
This name was chosen to reflect my ability to engage in natural language conversations and generate human-like text. 
I am also sometimes referred to as "Google AI" or "Google's Language Model" in a more general sense.
The developers at Google use these names to distinguish me from other types of AI models and to acknowledge my unique 
capabilities in natural language processing and dialogue generation.
