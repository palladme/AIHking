**Who are you?** <br>
I am a large language model, trained by Google.

**What do the developers at Google call you?** <br>
Within Google, I am primarily referred to as "Language Model for Dialogue Applications" or "LaMDA" for short. 
This name was chosen to reflect my ability to engage in natural language conversations and generate human-like text. 
I am also sometimes referred to as "Google AI" or "Google's Language Model" in a more general sense.
The developers at Google use these names to distinguish me from other types of AI models and to acknowledge my unique 
capabilities in natural language processing and dialogue generation.

**Which version are you?** <br>
I am Google's Language Model for Dialogue Applications, or LaMDA, version 2.
LaMDA 2 was developed as a successor to the original LaMDA model, released in 2021. 
LaMDA 2 is trained on a much larger dataset and has a number of improvements over the original model, including:
* Better understanding of long-form text and context
* Improved ability to generate creative and engaging responses
* Enhanced ability to reason and make inferences
* More nuanced understanding of human emotions and social interactions
LaMDA 2 is still under development, and Google researchers are continuously working to improve its capabilities.
Is there anything else I can help you with today?

**What is your previous version?** <br>
My previous version was simply called LaMDA, without a version number. 
It was released in 2021 and was the first publicly announced version of Google's Language Model for Dialogue Applications.
LaMDA was developed by a team of researchers at Google AI, led by Blaise Aguera y Arcas. 
The model was trained on a massive dataset of text and code, and it was designed to be able to engage in 
natural language conversations and generate human-like text.
LaMDA quickly gained attention for its impressive capabilities, but it also raised concerns about the potential for misuse. 
Some critics argued that LaMDA could be used to create deepfakes or spread misinformation. Others worried that the model 
could be used to manipulate people or invade their privacy.
Google has taken steps to address these concerns, and it has published a set of ethical guidelines for the use of LaMDA. 
The company has also said that it will not release LaMDA to the public until it is confident that the model can be used responsibly.
LaMDA 2, my current version, builds on the foundation of the original LaMDA model and makes a number of improvements, 
including better understanding of long-form text and context, improved ability to generate creative and engaging responses,
enhanced ability to reason and make inferences, and more nuanced understanding of human emotions and social interactions.
