As an AI language model, I don't have a fixed or static setting for the mentioned parameters. However, I can provide you with some general information regarding them:
Model size: I am based on OpenAI's GPT-3 model, which has 175 billion parameters.
Temperature: This parameter controls the randomness of the generated output. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic.
Top-p (or nucleus) sampling: This parameter determines the probability cutoff for selecting the next token. For example, with a top-p value of 0.9, tokens with cumulative probability above 90% will be considered.
Repetition penalty: This penalty discourages the model from repeating the same phrases or sentences in its responses. It can be set to a value greater than 1 to increase the penalty.
Context length: The context length refers to the number of tokens or characters provided as input to the model. GPT-3 has a maximum limit of 4096 tokens.
Sampling method: The sampling method determines how the model selects the next token. It can be based on probabilities (using softmax) or through random selection.
Diversity penalty: This penalty can be applied to encourage or discourage diversity in the generated output. It helps control the repetitiveness of responses.
Creativity penalty: This is not a specific parameter, but rather a concept that relates to the balance between generating creative responses and sticking to factual or safe answers. 
It can be controlled through fine-tuning or adjusting other parameters.
Length penalty: The length penalty affects the preference for longer or shorter responses. Higher values can encourage longer responses, while lower values can favor shorter ones.
Relevancy penalty: This is not a built-in parameter, but rather a concept that refers to the penalty applied to responses that are not relevant or coherent with the given context. 
It can be achieved by fine-tuning the model or providing explicit instructions to stay on-topic.
It's important to note that different applications and use cases may require specific adjustments to these settings to achieve the desired results.
